## Component Architecture

```
src/components/team/
â”œâ”€â”€ TeamSection.tsx     # Main container component
â”œâ”€â”€ TeamCard.tsx        # Individual team member card
â”œâ”€â”€ ExpandedPanel.tsx   # Detailed info panel that slides down
â””â”€â”€ index.ts           # Export barrel file
```

## Component Usage

### TeamSection (Main Component)

```tsx

function About() {
  return (
    <div className="container">

  onToggle={() => void}
/>
```

### ExpandedPanel Component

```tsx
import ExpandedPanel from '@/components/team/ExpandedPanel'

<ExpandedPanel 
  member={teamMember}
  isVisible={boolean}
/>
```

**Props:**
- `member: TeamMember` - Team member data object  
- `isVisible: boolean` - Controls visibility and animations

**Features:**
- Larger profile image
- Full biography text
- Skills with hover effects
- Statistics with emojis
- Fun facts list
- Social media links with brand colors
- Slide-down/fade animation
- Auto-scroll when panel opens

## Data Structure

The components expect team member data in the following format:

```typescript
interface TeamMember {
  id: string;              // Unique identifier
  name: string;            // Display name
  title: string;           // Job title/tagline
  role: string;            // Detailed role description
  bio: string;             // Short biography
  fullBio: string;         // Extended biography for expanded panel
  avatar: string;          // Path to profile image
  skills: string[];        // Array of skill names
  funFacts: string[];      // Array of fun facts
  stats: {                 // Statistics to display
    label: string;
    value: string;
    emoji: string;
  }[];
  socials: {              // Social media links
    label: string;        // Display name
    href: string;         // Link URL
    icon: LucideIcon;     // Icon component from lucide-react
    color: string;        // Hex color for hover effects
  }[];
}
```

## Adding New Team Members

1. **Update team data** in `/src/data/team.ts`:

```typescript
export const teamMembers: Record<string, TeamMember> = {
  // ... existing members
  newMember: {
    id: 'newMember',
    name: 'NEW MEMBER',
    title: 'The Creative Mind',
    role: 'UI/UX Designer',
    bio: 'Creates beautiful user experiences.',
    fullBio: 'Extended biography here...',
    avatar: '/images/newmember.png',
    skills: ['Figma', 'Sketch', 'Adobe XD'],
    funFacts: ['Loves coffee', 'Night owl'],
    stats: [
      { label: 'Designs', value: '50+', emoji: 'ðŸŽ¨' }
    ],
    socials: [
      {
        label: 'Portfolio',
        href: 'https://portfolio.com',
        icon: Globe,
        color: '#A10000'
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

2. **Add profile image** to `/public/images/newmember.png`

3. The new member will automatically appear in the team section!

## Styling Customization

The components use Tailwind CSS classes and can be customized by:

1. **Modifying color schemes** - Update red-based colors (red-500, red-400, etc.)
2. **Adjusting animations** - Modify Framer Motion variants
3. **Changing glassmorphism effects** - Update backdrop-blur and opacity values
4. **Responsive breakpoints** - Adjust grid layouts and text sizes

## Accessibility Features

- âœ… **Keyboard navigation** - All interactive elements are focusable
- âœ… **Screen reader support** - Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- âœ… **Focus indicators** - Visible focus rings on interactive elements
- âœ… **Reduced motion** - Respects user's motion preferences
- âœ… **Color contrast** - WCAG compliant color combinations
- âœ… **Alternative text** - Images have descriptive alt attributes

## Performance Optimizations

- âœ… **Lazy loading** - Next.js Image component with automatic optimization
- âœ… **Hardware acceleration** - CSS transforms use GPU acceleration  
- âœ… **Efficient re-renders** - State managed at component level
- âœ… **Bundle optimization** - Tree-shakable imports
- âœ… **Animation performance** - Uses transform and opacity for smooth 60fps

## Browser Support

- âœ… **Modern browsers** - Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- âœ… **Mobile responsive** - iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile
- âœ… **Graceful degradation** - Works without JavaScript
- âœ… **Progressive enhancement** - Animations enhance but don't break core functionality

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:

- [ ] **Search/filter functionality** - Filter team members by skills or role
- [ ] **Modal view** - Alternative full-screen detail view
- [ ] **Drag-to-reorder** - Allow customizing team member order
- [ ] **Team member availability** - Show online/offline status
- [ ] **Integration with CMS** - Dynamic team member management
- [ ] **Analytics tracking** - Track which team members get most views

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Cards don't expand:**
- Check that team data is properly imported
- Ensure member IDs are unique strings
- Verify onClick handlers are connected

**Images not loading:**
- Confirm image paths in `/public/images/`
- Check that avatar paths in team data are correct
- Ensure Next.js Image component has proper src

**Animations not working:**
- Verify Framer Motion is installed
- Check for reduced motion preferences
- Ensure components are wrapped in MotionConfig

**TypeScript errors:**
- Ensure all team member objects match TeamMember interface
- Check that Lucide React icons are properly imported
- Verify proper typing for social links

## Component Integration

The team section is fully integrated into the About page (`/src/app/About/page.tsx`) and can be easily moved to other pages if needed. The design matches the existing ONYXDEV brand with dark theme, red accents, and glassmorphism effects.
