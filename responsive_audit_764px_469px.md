# Responsive Layout Audit: 764px → 469px

## Overview
This audit analyzes the behavior of key layout elements when the viewport is resized from 764px down to 469px in 50-100px decrements.

## Key Breakpoint Analysis

The current CSS has these relevant breakpoints:
- `@media (max-width: 768px)` - Tablet styles
- `@media (max-width: 480px)` - Mobile styles

**CRITICAL ISSUE**: There is a **gap between 768px and 480px** where no specific responsive rules apply, which is exactly our problem area (764px → 469px).

## Element-by-Element Analysis

### 1. Samurai Image Container (`.samuraiImageContainer`)

**Current Behavior:**
- At 764px: Uses tablet styles (width: 85%, height: 75vh)
- 469px-480px: Still uses tablet styles
- Below 480px: Switches to mobile styles (width: 90%, height: 65vh)

**Identified Issues:**
- **Fixed width of 85%** may cause horizontal overflow on smaller screens
- **Height of 75vh** could push content off-screen
- **Positioned absolutely** with `left: 50%` and `transform: translateX(-50%)` may overflow viewport edges

**CSS Selectors with Issues:**
```css
.samuraiImageContainer {
  position: absolute;
  bottom: 0px;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translateX(-50%);
  width: 80%; /* Too wide for mid-range screens */
  height: 80vh; /* Too tall, may cause overflow */
}

@media (max-width: 1023px) and (min-width: 769px) {
  .samuraiImageContainer {
    width: 85%; /* Still problematic */
    height: 75vh;
  }
}
```

### 2. Creative Coders Box (`.creativeCoders`)

**Current Behavior:**
- Fixed positioning at `bottom: 0rem, right: 2rem`
- Fixed width of 240px (tablet: 220px)
- No specific styles for 469px-764px range

**Identified Issues:**
- **Fixed width of 220-240px** may cause horizontal overflow on narrow screens
- **Right positioning of 2rem** could push element off-screen
- May overlap with samurai image on smaller viewports

**CSS Selectors with Issues:**
```css
.creativeCoders {
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 0rem;
  right: 2rem;
  width: 240px; /* Too wide for narrow screens */
}

@media (max-width: 1023px) and (min-width: 769px) {
  .creativeCoders {
    width: 220px; /* Still too wide */
  }
}
```

### 3. Terminal Text (`.terminalText`)

**Current Behavior:**
- Fixed positioning at `bottom: 1rem, left: 2rem`
- `white-space: nowrap` prevents text wrapping
- Only gets wrapping styles below 768px

**Identified Issues:**
- **Fixed left margin of 2rem** reduces available width
- **No wrapping until 768px** may cause horizontal scroll
- Text may overlap with other elements

**CSS Selectors with Issues:**
```css
.terminalText {
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 1rem;
  left: 2rem; /* Reduces available width */
}

.terminalText p {
  white-space: nowrap; /* Causes overflow on narrow screens */
}
```

### 4. Main Text Container (`.mainText`)

**Current Behavior:**
- Large top margin (8rem desktop, 6rem tablet)
- Fixed left margin (2rem desktop, 1.5rem tablet)
- Only adjusts at 768px breakpoint

**Identified Issues:**
- **Large margins** may not be optimal for mid-range screens
- **No gradual adjustment** between breakpoints

### 5. Logo (`.logo`)

**Current Behavior:**
- Fixed positioning with specific top/left values
- Only adjusts at 768px breakpoint

**Identified Issues:**
- **May overlap** with tagline on narrower screens in the gap range

## Viewport-Specific Issues by Width Range

### 764px
- Samurai image at 85% width may start showing slight overflow
- Creative coders box (220px) takes significant horizontal space
- Terminal text starts getting cramped

### 714px  
- Creative coders box becomes more prominent relative to viewport
- Samurai image positioning may cause subtle overflow
- Text elements may start feeling cramped

### 664px
- **CRITICAL**: Creative coders box (220px) + right margin (2rem ≈ 32px) = ~252px
- This leaves only ~412px for main content - very cramped
- Terminal text with left margin reduces usable space significantly

### 614px
- Horizontal scrolling likely begins due to fixed widths
- Samurai image container becomes too prominent
- Text readability decreases due to space constraints

### 564px
- **MAJOR OVERFLOW EXPECTED**: Fixed elements definitely cause horizontal scroll
- Creative coders box dominates the right side
- Terminal text may be partially hidden

### 514px
- Severe layout breakdown expected
- Multiple elements likely overlapping
- Horizontal scroll definitely present

### 469px
- Just before mobile breakpoint (480px)
- Layout completely broken in current implementation
- Fixed elements cause major overflow issues

## Recommended CSS Selectors for Immediate Fixes

### High Priority Issues:
1. `.samuraiImageContainer` - width and positioning
2. `.creativeCoders` - fixed width and right positioning  
3. `.terminalText p` - white-space and positioning
4. `.mainText` - margin adjustments
5. `.eleganceText` - bottom positioning conflicts

### Medium Priority:
1. `.logo` - potential overlap with tagline
2. `.timeText` in tagline component - margin adjustments

## Next Steps
1. Add intermediate breakpoint around 600-650px
2. Implement fluid widths instead of fixed widths
3. Adjust positioning values for better spacing
4. Test overflow behavior with horizontal scrolling
5. Ensure no elements are pushed off-canvas

## Screenshots Needed
- 764px: Baseline behavior
- 714px: First signs of cramping
- 664px: Creative coders box prominence
- 614px: Potential overflow start
- 564px: Major layout issues
- 514px: Severe breakdown  
- 469px: Pre-mobile breakpoint chaos
